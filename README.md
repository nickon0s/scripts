# Useful scripts
Some random scripts I made to make life easier.

## Proxy_Finder.py
Grabs a bunch of HTTPS proxies from SSLProxies.org, then checks if they are live on a 5 second timeout.

## Shodan_Ports.sh
Add an API key for Shodan and run with a list of domains as an argument to return open ports on each IP.

## VM-Fix.sh
Fixes annoying bug with VMware tools that stops copy/paste working sometimes by restarting services.

## VPS-Setup.sh
Script to install tools for some basic recon on a fresh Ubuntu VPS.
