# Useful scripts
Some random scripts I made to make life easier.    


## Shodan_Ports
Add an API key for Shodan and run with a list of domains as an argument to return open ports on each IP.

## VM-Fix
Fixes annoying bug with VMware tools that stops copy/paste working sometimes but restarting services.

## VPS-Setup
Script to install tools for some basic recon on a fresh Ubuntu VPS.
